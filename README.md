# MNIST-Neural-Network
This project implements a neural network from scratch to classify the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The neural network is built using numpy for numerical computations and matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.7% on the test set.
