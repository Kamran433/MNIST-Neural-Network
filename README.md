# MNIST Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a neural network from scratch to classify the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The neural network is built using numpy for numerical computations and matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.7% on the test set.

## Features
- Custom implementation of a neural network using only numpy, and pandas library.
- Training and testing on the MNIST dataset
- Visualization of training progress and results using matplotlib.pyplot

## Requirements
- Python 3
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/Kamran433/MNIST-Neural-Network]`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the `main.py` script to train and test the neural network.

## Results
- Training accuracy: 99.8%
- Test accuracy: 99.7%

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different network architectures and hyperparameters
- Implement more advanced optimization techniques such as Adam or RMSprop
- Explore other datasets and problems to apply the neural network to
